# Phase 3: Location Services Implementation - Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of location services for the OpenSea marine navigation app, as specified in the requirements for Phase 3.

## Original Requirements

The original prompt required implementing location services to track the device's position in real-time and calculate navigation metrics like speed in knots. Specific tasks included:

1. Creating a common location service interface
2. Implementing Android-specific location service
3. Implementing iOS-specific location service
4. Adding speed calculation functionality

## Implemented Features

### 1. Location Service Interface

- Created a common `LocationService` interface in the shared module with methods for:
  - Starting and stopping location updates
  - Getting current location as a Flow
  - Getting speed in knots
  - Requesting and checking location permissions
- Defined the `Location` data model with properties for:
  - Latitude and longitude
  - Altitude
  - Speed
  - Bearing
  - Accuracy
  - Timestamp

### 2. Android Location Implementation

- Implemented `AndroidLocationService` using FusedLocationProviderClient
- Configured location request parameters optimized for marine use:
  - High accuracy priority
  - 1-second update interval
  - 500ms minimum update interval
  - 2-second maximum update delay
- Added location permission handling
- Implemented conversion from Android Location to domain Location model
- Added recent location tracking for speed calculations
- Implemented speed smoothing algorithm to reduce fluctuations

### 3. iOS Location Implementation

- Created `IOSLocationService` as a placeholder implementation
- Added comments explaining how it would use CLLocationManager in a real application
- Provided simulated location data for demonstration purposes
- Included conversion from meters per second to knots

### 4. Location Utilities

- Implemented `LocationUtils` with comprehensive functions for:
  - Converting between different speed units (m/s, knots, km/h, mph)
  - Calculating distance using the Haversine formula
  - Calculating speed between two locations
  - Smoothing speed readings to reduce fluctuations
- Added extension function to convert Float speed to knots

## Technical Details

- Used Kotlin Flows for reactive location updates
- Implemented smoothing algorithm that removes outliers (values more than 2 standard deviations from the mean)
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Optimized for battery usage by providing methods to start and stop location updates

## Next Steps

As specified in the project plan, the next phase will focus on integrating the location service with the map component and implementing the main navigation UI.
