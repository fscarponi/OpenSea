# Phase 1: Project Setup and KMM Configuration

## Objective
Set up the basic Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) project structure and configure the development environment.

## Tasks

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- Install Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
- Install necessary SDKs and dependencies
- Note: Xcode is already installed
- Note: Git repository is already configured

### 1.2 Configure KMM Project
- Configure the current project for KMM development
- Configure project name and package structure
- Set up the shared module for cross-platform code
- Configure build.gradle files for all modules
- Test basic compilation on both Android and iOS

### 1.3 Project Structure Organization
- Organize the shared module with the following structure:
  - commonMain/domain (business logic)
  - commonMain/data (data sources and repositories)
  - commonMain/presentation (ViewModels and state holders)
- Set up platform-specific directories:
  - androidMain for Android-specific implementations
  - iosMain for iOS-specific implementations
- Create placeholder files to maintain directory structure

### 1.4 Version Control Management
- Note: Git repository is already initialized
- Update .gitignore file with any additional entries needed for KMM development
- Commit changes to the project structure after KMM configuration

## Expected Outcome
A properly configured KMM project with the basic directory structure in place, ready for architecture setup and dependency configuration.

## Next Steps
Proceed to architecture setup and dependency injection configuration.
