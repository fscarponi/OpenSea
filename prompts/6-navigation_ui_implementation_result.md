# Phase 4: Navigation UI Implementation - Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the navigation user interface for the OpenSea marine navigation app, as specified in the requirements for Phase 4, Step 6.

## Implemented Components

### 1. MarkerRepository

- Created a `MarkerRepository` interface in the domain layer with methods for:
  - Getting all markers
  - Getting a marker by ID
  - Adding a marker
  - Updating a marker
  - Deleting a marker
- Implemented `MarkerRepositoryImpl` in the data layer with an in-memory storage solution

### 2. NavigationViewModel

- Created a `NavigationViewModel` that connects location and map services
- Implemented state management using `NavigationUiState` data class
- Added functionality for:
  - Tracking current location and speed
  - Following user's location on the map
  - Dropping markers at the current location
  - Changing map modes (standard, satellite, nautical)

### 3. UI Components

- Added Compose Multiplatform dependencies to the project
- Created UI components:
  - `SpeedIndicator`: Displays the current speed in knots
  - `NavigationControls`: Provides buttons for following location and dropping markers
  - `NavigationScreen`: Main screen that combines the map, speed indicator, and navigation controls

### 4. Dependency Injection

- Updated the Koin DI module to provide:
  - `MarkerRepository` as a singleton
  - `NavigationViewModel` as a factory

## Implementation Details

### MarkerRepository

The `MarkerRepository` interface defines methods for managing markers, while the `MarkerRepositoryImpl` provides an in-memory implementation that stores markers in a map and exposes them as a flow.

### NavigationViewModel

The `NavigationViewModel` connects the location service, map controller, and marker repository to provide navigation functionality. It manages the UI state and provides methods for interacting with the map and markers.

Key features:
- Location tracking with automatic map centering
- Marker creation at the current location
- Map mode switching with appropriate styling

### UI Components

The UI components are implemented using Compose Multiplatform, providing a consistent user experience across platforms:

- `SpeedIndicator`: A card that displays the current speed in knots
- `NavigationControls`: A column of floating action buttons for map interactions
- `NavigationScreen`: A box layout that combines all components

## Next Steps

As specified in the project plan, the next phase will focus on implementing marker visualization and management features, which will build upon the foundation laid in this phase.
