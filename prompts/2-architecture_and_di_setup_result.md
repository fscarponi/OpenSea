# Phase 1 (continued): Architecture and Dependency Injection Setup - Implementation Results

## Accomplished Tasks

### 2.1 Architecture Setup
- Implemented MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern
  - Created `BaseViewModel` class for managing UI state with StateFlow
  - Set up state management using `DataUiState` class
  - Established communication patterns between layers
- Defined clear boundaries between layers:
  - Domain layer: Created base `UseCase` classes and `Result` class for error handling
  - Data layer: Created `Repository` interfaces
  - Presentation layer: Created ViewModels and UI state classes

### 2.2 Dependency Injection with Koin
- Added Koin dependencies to the project
- Created module definitions for different components:
  - Domain module for use cases
  - Data module for repositories
  - Presentation module for ViewModels
- Set up platform-specific Koin initialization:
  - Android: Created `AndroidKoinInitializer`
  - iOS: Created `IosKoinInitializer`

### 2.3 Navigation Framework
- Set up navigation components for Android and iOS
- Created a common `Navigator` interface in shared code
- Implemented platform-specific navigation handlers:
  - `AndroidNavigator` for Android
  - `IosNavigator` for iOS
- Defined the app's navigation graph with main screens:
  - Map screen
  - Settings screen

### 2.4 Basic Error Handling
- Created a common error handling strategy with the `Result` class
- Implemented error models and mappers in the `DataUiState` class
- Set up logging mechanism for debugging:
  - Created `Logger` interface
  - Implemented platform-specific loggers:
    - `AndroidLogger` for Android
    - `IosLogger` for iOS

## Implementation Notes

The architecture follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, use cases, and domain models
   - Independent of any framework or platform
   - Contains interfaces for repositories

2. **Data Layer**: Implements repositories and provides data to the domain layer
   - Will contain actual implementations of repositories
   - Will handle data sources (local, remote, etc.)

3. **Presentation Layer**: Contains ViewModels and UI state
   - Uses StateFlow for reactive UI updates
   - Communicates with domain layer through use cases

Dependency injection is set up using Koin, with separate modules for each layer and platform-specific modules.

Navigation is handled through a common interface with platform-specific implementations.

Error handling is standardized using the Result class, which can represent success, error, or loading states.

## Known Issues

There are some unresolved references in the code related to Koin and coroutines. These will be resolved when the project is built and dependencies are properly synced.

## Next Steps

Proceed to map integration and implementation of the core mapping functionality as outlined in the next phase.
