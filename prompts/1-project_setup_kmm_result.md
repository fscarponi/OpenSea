# Phase 1: Project Setup and KMM Configuration - Results

## Completed Tasks

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- Configured Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development environment
- Set up necessary SDK configurations in gradle.properties
- Noted that Xcode is already installed
- Noted that Git repository is already configured

### 1.2 Configure KMM Project
- Configured the project for KMM development by updating Gradle files:
  - Updated gradle.properties with KMM-specific properties
  - Updated settings.gradle.kts with KMM plugins and module structure
  - Updated root build.gradle.kts for multi-module support
- Set up the shared module for cross-platform code
- Created the androidApp module for the Android application
- Configured build.gradle.kts files for all modules

### 1.3 Project Structure Organization
- Organized the shared module with the following structure:
  - commonMain/domain (business logic)
  - commonMain/data (data sources and repositories)
  - commonMain/presentation (ViewModels and state holders)
- Set up platform-specific directories:
  - androidMain for Android-specific implementations
  - iosMain for iOS-specific implementations
- Created placeholder README.md files in each directory to maintain structure and document purpose

### 1.4 Version Control Management
- Updated .gitignore file with additional entries for KMM development:
  - Android-specific build files
  - iOS-specific build files
  - KMM-specific build artifacts

## Project Structure
The project now has the following structure:
