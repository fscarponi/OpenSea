# Update to Project Setup Plan

## Original Prompt
Edit plan step 1:
– We use IntelliJ IDEA instead of Android Studio.
– Git is already set up.
– Xcode is already installed.
– We will use the current project, so there is no need to create a new one.

With that clarified, proceed with Phase 1: Project Setup and KMM Configuration (do not proceed to the next step).

## Task Result
Updated the Phase 1 project setup plan in `1-project_setup_kmm.md` to reflect the following changes:

1. Changed development environment from Android Studio to IntelliJ IDEA
2. Acknowledged that Xcode is already installed
3. Acknowledged that Git repository is already configured
4. Modified the project creation step to use the current project instead of creating a new one
5. Updated the Version Control section to focus on management rather than initial setup

These changes align the project setup plan with the actual development environment and project status, avoiding unnecessary steps while maintaining the core KMM configuration requirements.
