# Phase 1 (continued): Architecture and Dependency Injection Setup

## Objective
Establish a clean architecture pattern and configure dependency injection for the project.

## Tasks

### 2.1 Architecture Setup
- Implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern
  - Create base classes for ViewModels
  - Set up state management using StateFlow
  - Establish communication patterns between layers
- Define clear boundaries between layers:
  - Domain layer (business logic)
  - Data layer (repositories and data sources)
  - Presentation layer (ViewModels and UI state)

### 2.2 Dependency Injection with Koin
- Add Koin dependencies to the project
  ```kotlin
  // In shared module build.gradle.kts
  implementation("io.insert-koin:koin-core:3.2.0")
  ```
- Create module definitions for different components:
  ```kotlin
  // Example module definition
  val appModule = module {
      single { LocationService() }
      viewModel { NavigationViewModel(get(), get()) }
  }
  ```
- Set up platform-specific Koin initialization:
  - Android: Initialize in Application class
  - iOS: Initialize in SwiftUI App struct

### 2.3 Navigation Framework
- Set up navigation components for Android and iOS
- Create a common navigation interface in shared code
- Implement platform-specific navigation handlers
- Define the app's navigation graph with main screens:
  - Map screen
  - Settings screen (if applicable)

### 2.4 Basic Error Handling
- Create a common error handling strategy
- Implement error models and mappers
- Set up logging mechanism for debugging

## Expected Outcome
A well-structured application with clean architecture principles, properly configured dependency injection, and a navigation system that works across platforms.

## Next Steps
Proceed to map integration and implementation of the core mapping functionality.
