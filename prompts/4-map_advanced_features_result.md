# Phase 2 (continued): Map Advanced Features - Implementation Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of advanced map features for the OpenSea marine navigation app, as specified
in the requirements for Phase 2, Step 4.

## Implemented Features

### 1. OpenStreetMap Tile Integration

- Configured the map to use OpenStreetMap as the default tile provider
- Added tile caching functionality for offline capability
- Implemented handling for different zoom levels
- Added OSM attribution as required by their license

### 2. Marker Management System

- Created a Marker data model with properties for:
    - Unique ID
    - Position (LatLng)
    - Title
    - Description
    - Icon type (DEFAULT, ANCHOR, WAYPOINT, DANGER)
- Implemented marker clustering for handling many markers
- Added comprehensive marker operations:
    - Adding markers with various properties
    - Updating existing markers
    - Removing markers
    - Retrieving all markers

### 3. Map Interaction Handling

- Implemented touch/click event handling
- Added support for:
    - Panning
    - Zooming
    - Long press (for adding markers)
- Created map state management to track:
    - Current center position
    - Zoom level
    - Visible region
    - Active markers

### 4. Map Style and Appearance

- Implemented marine-specific map styling
- Added day/night mode toggle
- Added scale indicator and compass controls
- Configured map labels appropriate for marine navigation

## Implementation Details

### New Model Classes

- Created `Marker` data class and `MarkerIconType` enum for marker management
- Enhanced `MapConfiguration` with properties for:
    - Tile caching
    - Night mode
    - Marine styling
    - OSM attribution

### Enhanced Event Handling

- Added new event types to `MapEvent`:
    - `MapLongPress` for adding markers
    - `ClusterClick` for marker cluster interactions
    - `TilesLoading` and `TilesLoaded` for tracking tile loading states
    - `StyleChanged` for style changes (day/night mode)

### MapController Interface

- Extended with new methods for:
    - Advanced marker management
    - Map styling and appearance
    - Tile caching and offline functionality

### Platform-Specific Implementations

- Updated `AndroidMapController` with MapLibre-specific implementations
- Updated `IOSMapController` with MapKit-specific implementations
- Both implementations provide consistent behavior across platforms

## Testing

The implementation has been tested to ensure:

- Proper marker management across platforms
- Correct handling of map interactions
- Appropriate styling and appearance options
- Functional tile caching for offline use

## Next Steps

As specified in the project plan, the next phase will focus on implementing location services and real-time position
tracking.
